        <p class="profile__story">
          Hello there! I'm Finn, a lively and curious fennec fox living at the
          Wildlife Sanctuary. Born in the heart of the Sahara Desert, I was
          rescued by the kind folks at the sanctuary when I was just a pup. My
          large ears help me stay cool in the desert heat and hear the faintest
          sounds of potential friends or foes.
        </p>
        <p class="profile__story">
          I love to dig burrows and explore my surroundings with my sharp
          senses. My favorite activities include playing hide-and-seek with my
          caretakers and nibbling on delicious treats like insects and fruits.
          I'm known for my playful antics and energetic personality, making me a
          favorite among visitors.
        </p>
        <p class="profile__story">
          I'm looking for generous sponsors to support my stay at the sanctuary.
          Your sponsorship will help provide me with nutritious food, medical
          care, and enrichment activities that keep me happy and healthy. In
          return, you'll receive regular updates about my adventures and
          exclusive photos of me enjoying life at the sanctuary.
        </p>
        <p class="profile__story">
          Join my adventure and become a part of my family by sponsoring me
          today. Thank you for your kindness and support!
